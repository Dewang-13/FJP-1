Hi Friends,

Many of you have received this email earlier today. I am resending it so that all those who have been added to the list later can receive 1st lecture's recordings.

Hi friends,

So, we had a rollercoaster first lecture. Apologies from our side for the mistakes.

Minutes of the meeting
1. NADOS Signup crashed because the limit of 3000 OTPs was over and invalid OTPs were being delivered.
2. Due to a lack of communication channels, zoom webinar links could not be sent timely. (now we have this group as a communication channel)
3. Eventually we had a lecture at 10:00 pm and nearly everyone (99%) attended.
4. We started on the old pepcoding site and starting "Getting Started" of Level 1. We got introduced to "Printing in Java" and "Variables in Java".
5. Homework was an MCQ on "Variables in Java"
6. Please find attached the recording of the class.
 Lecture 1.mp4
7. The pdf at the last note in the class is attached at the bottom (will start posting proper notes from today's class)

Agenda for today
1. Communication channel is ready (fjp1@pepcoding.com)
2. We will call you individually and help you signup on NADOS throughout the day.
3. Let us meet at 8 pm tonight on this zoom link - https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_G36gAnNZSCKj1hlhi0OVsg
4. Doubts - You've filled the google form. I will check the google form for unique entries and post videos (or textual replies) as FAQs on the NADOS app.
5. Schedule - The schedule for the first 30 days at low-level and 12 months at a high level will be shared on the NADOS app as a video.
